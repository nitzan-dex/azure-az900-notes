# Introduction to Cloud Computing


### Define cloud computing.
Computing services provided over the internet.

### Extra: Why would I use a cloud service provider?
- Pay only for the services used. 
- Don't have to manage your own hardware resources.
- Scale or de-scale quickly.

### Describe the shared responsibility model.
When using a cloud provider, youâ€™ll always be responsible for:

    data
    edge devices
    Identity

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

    The physical datacenter
    The physical network
    The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

    Operating systems
    Network controls
    Applications
    Identity and infrastructure


### Extra: What responsibilities fall "in-between" a IaaS and SaaS?
1. Identity 
2. Applications
3. Network controls
4. Operating System 



### Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
Cloud models "define the deployment type of cloud resources." They're the "types" of clouds, where a cloud is just a collection of services provided via the internet. 

1. private: A private cloud is only used by a single organization. 
	- The data centers can be hosted on-site or by a third-party. 
	- You data isn't colocated with data from other orgs, which may be required (e.g. HIPAA).
	- More control but also more costly.
2. public: A cloud built, controlled, and maintained by a CSP.
	- Less control but cost advantages from economies of scale (i.e. hardware resources purchased in "bulk" by CSP, savings distributed to consumers)
3. hybrid: A cloud utilizing both private and public clouds.
	- Start with private cloud, then surges in demand can be handled by public cloud (because they're quicker to set up).
### Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model

### Extra: What is multicloud?
Using multiple CSPs. You may want to use a mish-mash of services. Or you may be migrating from one CSP to another.  

### Describe the consumption-based model

### Compare cloud pricing models.
2 types:

1. Capital expenditure: Pay up-front, saves money if you know your costs ahead of time.
2. Operational expenditure: On-demand payment, can pay for more resources if needed and stop paying for resources that aren't used.

CSPs are OpEx.

### Describe serverless
CSP dynamically manage servers, to acheive stateless ephemeral computing.
