# Benefits of Using Cloud Services

**Summary**: Be able to describe the difference between the benefits of availability, scalability, reliability, predictability, governence/security, and manageability.

### Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud
**High Availability**  

Availability can be measured in percent-uptime. The higher the percent, the more it costs.  
Depending on the service, Azure has different uptimes SLAs

If they dont meet SLA they give discounts


### Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
**Reliability(resiliency)**  

**Scalablity**  
  Types: 
1. Vertical  
2. Horizontal  

**Predictability**  
Predictable performance and cost.  

- Performance: auto-scaling, load-balancing 
- Cost: Track expenditures in real time, apply data analytics to forecast and plan resource. Azure has a _Total Cost of Ownership_ (TCO) [calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/) 

### Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud
Azure services offer notifying if a service is out of compliance, or perfoming automatic software updates(Auto Managed in Paas And Saas).  

### Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud
The "what" and "how" of managing cloud resources. The training module calls these "" vs "management in" as the what and how, respecitively.  

**Management of**
- Autoscaling
- Preconfigured templates
- Health monitoring
- Alerts on performance metrics

**Management in**
- web portal
- CLIs
- APIs 
- PowerShell
